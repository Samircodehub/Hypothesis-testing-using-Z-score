# Hypothesis-testing-using-Z-score

 Z-Test is  statistical hypothesis test  used to determine if the difference between the sample mean and population mean is statistically significant.
 
 #### # Null hypothesis, H_0. This what you believe to be true from the population, which could be the mean of the population

#### # Alternate hypothesis, H_1. This what you observe from your sample. If the sample mean is different from the population’s mean, then we say the mean is not equal

Compute the Z-Test Statistic using the sample mean, μ_1, the population mean, μ_0, the number of data points in the sample, n and the population’s standard deviation, σ:

## # When to Use Z-test:

* The sample size should be greater than 30. Otherwise, we should use the t-test.
* Samples should be drawn at random from the population.
* The standard deviation of the population should be known.
* Samples that are drawn from the population should be independent of each other.
* The data should be normally distributed, however for large sample size, it is assumed to have a normal distribution.

Hypothesis Testing

A hypothesis is an educated guess/claim about a particular property of an object. Hypothesis testing is a way to validate the claim of an experiment.

## #Steps to perform Z-test:

* First, identify the null and alternate hypotheses.
* Determine the level of significance (∝).
* Find the critical value of z in the z-test using
* Calculate the z-test statistics. Below is the formula for calculating the z-test statistics.

where,
X¯: mean of the sample.
Mu: mean of the population.
Sd: Standard deviation of the population.
n: sample size.
Now compare with the hypothesis and decide whether to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis..
